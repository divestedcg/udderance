					<p>Sometimes the cord between my brain and mouth goes AWOL and so I wanted an alternative and cross-platform mechanism to engage in speech with others. Other existing FOSS AAC programs I tried were either too much or too invasive (accounts/trackers/etc.) for my usecase and liking, so I made this very simple one tailored for my specific needs. It currently has freeform input and two phrase board presets. Pictograms are also available thanks to the <a href="https://mulberrysymbols.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Mulberry Symbols</a> (CC BY-SA 4.0) project.</p>

						<p>Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) is a way for people to communicate when speaking is difficult or impossible. It includes everything from simple picture cards to electronic devices that can speak for you. AAC helps people express their thoughts, needs, and feelings, and it is used by people of all ages and abilities who experience communication challenges. Read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmentative_and_alternative_communication" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AAC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech-generating_device" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">SGDs</a> on Wikipedia.</p>

						<p>Here are other long-standing and proper solutions that are actively developed:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>AsTeRICS Grid: <a href="https://grid.asterics.eu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Website/PWA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Source Code (AGPL-3.0)</a>. Has one self-hosted tracker. Can be installed as a PWA.</li>
							<li>Cboard: <a href="https://www.cboard.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Website</a>, <a href="https://app.cboard.io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">PWA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cboard-org/cboard" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Source Code (GPL-3.0)</a>. Has many trackers embedded in <a href="https://reports.exodus-privacy.eu.org/en/reports/com.unicef.cboard/latest/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">the app</a> and <a href="/images/cboard-ubo.png" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">website</a> (PWA). Tested working on GrapheneOS with Internet permission revoked.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Here are some creative pocket-friendly alternatives that I explored:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Palm Pilot (eg. m105, m125): Can write notes using the Graffiti shorthand system via the `memo pad` app and create freeform sketches via the `note pad` app. They can be found used on places like eBay for $15-$30. They are powered by two AAA batteries and lasts a month. Their downside is that Graffiti can be annoying and the sketch area is quite small.</li>
							<li>Generic "LCD Writing Tablets": These are freeform sketch pads that do not persist and are available for under $10. They only use a button-cell battery to clear the screen and can last over a year of use. Their downside is that they can be hard to read depending on lighting conditions and the stylus isn't stored internally and instead dangles off the side by a weak magnet. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BBPV4491" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Example on Amazon</a></li>
						</ul>
						<p>What about the Live Speech feature on Apple products?</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Globally accessible via triple click of the power button</li>
							<li>Integrates with the Personal Voice feature</li>
							<li>No option to speak on space</li>
							<li>No option to immediately open the keyboard</li>
							<li>No option to import/export the saved phrases</li>
							<li>Bugs out when opened from the lock screen</li>
							<li>Inconsistently turns into a floating bubble</li>
						</ul>
