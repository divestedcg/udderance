					<p>Sometimes the cord between my brain and mouth goes AWOL and so I wanted an alternative and cross-platform mechanism to engage in speech with others. Other existing FOSS AAC programs I tried were either too much or too invasive (accounts/trackers/etc.) for my usecase and liking, so I made this very simple one tailored for my specific needs. It is currently quite spartan and not customizable so it may or may not be useful to others, but that'll hopefully be improved on in the future. Also the current voice selections are <a href="https://github.com/HadrienGardeur/web-speech-recommended-voices/issues/22" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">abysmal</a>.</p>

						<p>Here are other long-standing and proper solutions that are actively developed:<ul>
								<li>AsTeRICS Grid: <a href="https://grid.asterics.eu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Website/PWA</a>, <a href="https://github.com/asterics/AsTeRICS-Grid" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Source Code (AGPL-3.0)</a>.

						<p>Here are some creative pocket-friendly alternatives that I explored:<ul>
								<li>Palm Pilot (eg. m105, m125): Can write notes using the Graffiti shorthand system via the `memo pad` app and create freeform sketches via the `note pad` app. They can be found used on places like eBay for $15-$30. They are powered by two AAA batteries and lasts a month. Their downside is that Graffiti can be annoying and the sketch area is quite small.</li>
								<li>Generic "LCD Writing Tablets": These are freeform sketch pads that do not persist and are available for under $10. They only use a button-cell battery to clear the screen and can last over a year of use. Their downside is that they can be hard to read depending on lighting conditions and the stylus isn't stored internally and instead dangles off the side by a weak magnet. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BBPV4491" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Example on Amazon</a></li>
